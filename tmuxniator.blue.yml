#      The following layouts are supported:
# 
#      even-horizontal
#              Panes are spread out evenly from left to right across the window.
# 
#      even-vertical
#              Panes are spread evenly from top to bottom.
# 
#      main-horizontal
#              A large (main) pane is shown at the top of the window and the remaining panes are
#              spread from left to right in the leftover space at the bottom.  Use the
#              main-pane-height window option to specify the height of the top pane.
# 
#      main-vertical
#              Similar to main-horizontal but the large pane is placed on the left and the others
#              spread from top to bottom along the right.  See the main-pane-width window option.
